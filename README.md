# Front-end log viewer

## Basic requirements
- Time range: Last 5 minutes, last hour, last 24 hours, last 7 days
- Level filter
- Implement tailing, showing new logs as they come in, just like a terminal
- For each log line, show the timestamp and log message

## Other notes
- Feel free to:
  - Use online resources to unblock yourself
  - Install low-level utilities libraries or generic UI frameworks. Just nothing too domain-specific
